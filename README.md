Converter library for EN 16931:2017 invoices from UBL 2.1 to CII D16B

This version is based on the version of @VartikaG02: https://github.com/VartikaG02/en16931-ubl2cii - it was extended by adding CII conformance to the EN.
 Additionally UBL Credit Notes are supported and a commandline client was added.

This is a Java 11+ library that converts a Universal Business Language (UBL) 2.1 into a Cross Industry Invoice (CII) D16B document following the rules of the European Norm (EN) 16931 that defines a common semantic data model for electronic invoices in Europe.

This is the counterpart to https://github.com/phax/en16931-cii2ubl which can be used to convert CII D16B invoices to different UBL versions.

This library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
